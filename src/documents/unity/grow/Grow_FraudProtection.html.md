# Fraud Protection

<div class="info-box">General information about Fraud Protection available in this [article](/university/articles/Grow_FraudProtection).</div>

In order to turn on Fraud Protection in Unity3d, all you need to do is click on the `Fraud Protection` check box in Soomla Settings.
Optionally, you can turn on `Verify On Server Failure` if you want to get purchases automatically verified in case of
network failures during the verification process.

Additionally you need to provide specific params needed for your billing service provider.

* For Google Play go over to [Google Play Purchase Verification](/android/store/Store_GooglePlayVerification).
