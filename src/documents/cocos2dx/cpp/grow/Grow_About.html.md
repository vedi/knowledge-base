## About

Soomla GROW is SOOMLA's flagship, community-driven, data network. Mobile game studios can take advantage of the different GROW products in order to get valuable insights about their games' performance and increase retention and monetization.

GROW uses all of Soomla's modules: [Store](/cocos2dx/cpp/store/), [Profile](/cocos2dx/cpp/profile/) and [LevelUp](/cocos2dx/cpp/levelup/) to collect in-game data and render value for you. Studios may choose to use only specific modules, however, to benefit from the full power of GROW analytics we recommend that you integrate all three.

To get started with GROW, you can follow each one of different GROW bundles' tutorials:

- [GrowUltimate](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/GrowUltimate_GettingStarted)
- [GrowCompete](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/GrowCompete_GettingStarted)
- [GrowViral](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/GrowViral_GettingStarted)
- [GrowSpend](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/GrowSpend_GettingStarted)
- [GrowInsights](/cocos2dx/cpp/grow/GrowInsights_GettingStarted)


### Why use GROW?

- With GROW, you can take better actions on your users in order to increase **retention** and **monetization**. GROW's [Insights]() module will allow you to take actions at real time and the [Whales Report]() will float problems you might have with your payers so you know how you improve over time.

- The Analytics dashboard will provide you with <u>free</u> data about your game when you join the GROW network. In the dashboard, you'll be able to see aggregative analytics about your games and investigate its performance. You will also see analytics about the different modules you incorporated in your game and be able to investigate fraudulent purchases.

- SOOMLA has created some modules that will put your game on steroids and by that increases user experience and engagement. [Social Leaderboards](), [Gifting]() and [State & Economy Sync]() are the features every F2P game needs in order to increase its <u>virality</u> and <u>user engagement</u>
