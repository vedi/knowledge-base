# Event Handling

## About

Profile allows you to subscribe to events, be notified when they occur, and implement your own application-specific behavior to handle them once they occur.

<div class="info-box">Your game-specific behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.</div>

## How it Works

Events are triggered when SOOMLA wants to notify you about different things that happen involving Profile operations.

For example, when a user performs a social action such as uploading a status, an `EVENT_SOCIAL_ACTION_STARTED` event is fired as a result.


## Observing & Handling Events

SOOMLA uses the common way of dispatching events used in Cocos2d-x.
The names of such events are defined in `Soomla.ProfileConsts`, the data of the event are passes as arguments to the handlers. You can subscribe to any event from anywhere in your code.

** Subscribing **

Subscribe to events calling `Soomla.addHandler(eventName, handler, target)`,
where `handler` - is a function that will be called when event is fired, and `target` - is "thisArg" used in that call.

```js
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.ProfileConsts.EVENT_LOGIN_FINISHED, this.onLoginFinished, this);
```

** Handling **

Handle the event through your own custom function:

```js
onLoginFinished: function (userProfile, payload) {
  // your code is here
}
```
