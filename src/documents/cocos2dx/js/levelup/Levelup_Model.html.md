# Model & Operations

## LevelUp

`LevelUp` models out worlds, levels, scores, missions, and more, all in one framework that allows game developers to build their game structure and progressions behavior easily and effectively. The sense of progress that users feel in a game is what creates retention and long-term use, which usually lead to monetization.

In this document, you will find definitions of each of the entities of `LevelUp`, the connections between them, and code examples that demonstrate how to use them.

### LevelUp Hierarchy

After observing dozens of games, the SOOMLA team realized that most game progress and accomplishment can be packed into **worlds**. Worlds can contain both levels and worlds, and may have missions that can be completed in order to receive rewards.

![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/soomla_diagrams/LevelUp.png "Soomla LevelUp Model")

### Prerequisites

This document assumes that you have a good understanding of SOOMLA's Store module. If not, please take time to read about the [Economy Model](/cocos2dx/js/store/Store_Model), and then come back to this document.

The `Schedule` and `Reward` entities are widely used in the examples of this document. You can read about them [here](#auxiliary-models).


## SoomlaLevelUp

This class is the top level container for the cocos2dx-levelup model and definitions. It stores the configurations of the 
game's world-hierarchy and provides lookup methods for *LevelUp* model elements.

`SoomlaLevelUp` is the central point of initialization. To use *LevelUp* you'll need to compose `World`s, `Level`s, `Mission`s, `Score`s, `Gate`s, `Reward`s, and then initialize `SoomlaLevelUp` with your root `World`.

<br>
**Useful methods**

``` js
// Retrieve a `World` by its ID:
var world = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getWorld(WORLD_ITEM_ID);

// Retrieve a `Score` by its ID:
var score = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getScore(SCORE_ITEM_ID);

// Retrieve a `Gate` by its ID:
var gate = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getGate(GATE_ITEM_ID);

// Retrieve a `Mission` by its ID:
var mission = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getMission(MISSION_ITEM_ID);

// Retrieve a `Reward` by its ID:
var oldReward = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getReward(REWARD_ITEM_ID);

// Retrieve the number of Worlds in your game:
var numOfWorlds = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getWorldCount(true);

// Retrieve the number of Levels in a given World:
var levels = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getLevelCountInWorld(someWorld);

// Retrieve the number of `Level`s in the game:
var totalLevels = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getLevelCount();

// Retrieve the number of completed `Level`s:
var completedLevels = Soomla.soomlaLevelUp.getCompletedWorldCount();
```

<br>
## World

A game can have multiple `World`s or a single one, and `World`s can also contain other `World`s in them. In some games, these are referred to as level packs. Often, a `World` contains a set of `Level`s, or multiple sets. A `World` can also have a potential `Gate` that defines the criteria to enter it. Games that don’t have the concept of `World`s can be modeled as single `World` games.

**A `World` contains the following elements:**

- `gate` - The `Gate` that defines the criteria to enter this `World`.

- `innerWorldsMap` - The `World`s contained in this `World`.

- `scores` - A list of `Score`s that this `World` contains . In the class `World`, you can add, retrieve, set, increase and decrease `Score`s, whether there are multiple `Score`s, or a single one.

- `missions` - A list of `Mission`s that this `World` contains. In the class `World` you can add more `Mission`s.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

For your convenience, there are multiple ways to define a `World`.

``` js
// That's enough to provide just an ID.
var worldA = Soomla.Models.World.create({
    itemId: WORLD_A_ID
});

// Instantiation of gates, scores, and missions will
// be demonstrated in the relevant sections below.
var worldB = Soomla.Models.World.create({
	itemId: 'world_B_ID',
	gate: gate,
	innerWorlds: innerWorlds,  
	scores: scores,  
	missions: missions
});
```

<br>
**COMMON USE**

**Add `World`s or `Levels` to a `World`**:

``` js
// Create a batch of `Levels`s and add them to the `World`. Instead
// of creating many levels one by one, you can create them all at
// once, and save time.
worldA.batchAddLevelsWithTemplates(
	10,               // Number of levels in this world
	gate,             // Gate for each of the levels
	scores,           // Scores for each of the levels
	missions          // Missions for each of the levels
);

// Add an inner world
var innerWorld = Soomla.Models.World.create({
    itemId: 'inner_world'
});
worldA.addInnerWorld(innerWorld);

// Fetch an inner world
var world = worldA.getInnerWorldAt(0);
```

<br>
**Get/Set completion status:**

``` js
bool canStart = world.canStart(); // check world's status

worldA.setCompleted(true); //set as completed

bool isCompleted = worldA.isCompleted(); //check if complete
```

<br>
**Add elements to a `World`:**
You can add `Mission`s and `Score`s to an existing `World`.

``` js
worldA.addMission(someMission);

worldA.addScore(someScore);
```

<br>
**Manipulate/Query `Score`(s) of a `World`:**

Use the different methods provided in `World` to get, set, increase, and decrease its `Score`s.  You can use the 
`sumInnerWorldsRecords` method to sum up the `Score`s of the inner `World`s or `Level`s. Some methods are intended for 
a single `Score`, while others are for multiple `Score`s - you can differentiate between them according to their names 
and signatures.

``` js
/** For single scores: **/

worldA.setSingleScoreValue(300); // set score to 300

worldA.incSingleScore(100); // increase score by 100

worldA.decSingleScore(50); // decrease score by 50

var score =  worldA.getSingleScore(); // get score: value is 350


/** For multiple scores: **/

worldA.setScoreValue('some_score_ID', 500); // set SomeScore to 200

worldA.incScore('someScore', 200); // increase score by 200

worldA.decScore('someScore', 100); // decrease score by 50
```

<br>
**Manipulate/Query `Reward(s)` of a `World`:**

``` js
worldA.assignReward(coinReward); // assign a reward to this world

var rewardID = worldA.getAssignedRewardId(); // get reward ID
```

<br>
**Retrieve World Scores**

``` js
// Retrieve the record scores of worldA
var recordScores = worldA.getRecordScores();
_.each(recordScores, function (recordScore) {
    // Do something...
}

// Retrieve the latest scores of worldA
var latestScores = worldA.getLatestScores();
_.each(latestScores, function (recordScore) {
    // Do something...
}
```

<br>
## Level

One of the most common ways to create a sense of progress and accomplishment in games is to have levels. Every `Level` 
has a state, that is always one of: `Idle`, `Running`, `Paused`, `Ended`, or `Completed`. To use levels correctly, you 
need to use the provided `start`, `pause`, and `end` functions, in order for the level to keep an updated record of what 
its state is.

**A `Level` contains the following elements:**

- `startTime` - The start time of this level.

- `elapsed` - The duration of the play time for this level. This can be used for games that need to keep track of how 
long the user has been playing the level in order to calculate his / her `Score` at the end.

- `state` - The state of the level is initially `Idle`. While the user is playing the level is in `Running` mode, and 
can later be one of `Paused`, `Ended`, or `Completed`. The states are defined here: `Soomla.Models.Level.LevelState`.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

`Level` can be created with method `create` (see below). The section about `World`s, above, demonstrates the use of a 
function called `batchAddLevelsWithTemplates` which is much more convenient to use than method `create` of the `Level`.

``` js
var level1 = Soomla.Models.Level.create({
    itemId: 'level1ID'
});

var level2 = Soomla.Models.Level.create({
    itemId: 'level2ID',
	gate: gate,
	scores: scores,
	missions: missions
);
```

<br>
**COMMON USE**

**Start, pause, restart, or end this `Level`:**

``` js
level1.start();

level1.pause();

level1.start();

level1.end(true);

level1.restart(false);
```

<br>
**Manipulate a specific `Level`:**

``` js
level1.setCompleted(true);
```

<br>
**Query a specific level**

``` js
int timesPlayed = level1.getTimesPlayed();

int timesStarted = level1.getTimesStarted();

long slowDuration = level1.getSlowestDurationMillis();

long fastDuration = level1.getFastestDurationMillis();

long playDuration = level1.getPlayDurationMillis();
```

<br>
## Score

Represents a score in the game. A simple game usually has one generic numeric score which grows as the user progresses 
in the game. A game can also have multiple scores for different aspects such as time, speed, points, etc.

**A `Score` contains the following elements:**

- `startValue` - The initial `Score` value in the game.

- `higherBetter`- This field defines whether it's better that the score is higher or lower. A `Score` can be ascending in nature such as regular points (higher is better) or can be descending such as time-to-complete level (lower is better).

- `tempScore` - The *current* value of this score.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var score1 = Soomla.Models.Score.create({
    itemId: 'score1ID'
});

var score2 = Soomla.Models.Score.create({
    itemId: 'score2ID',                     // ID  
	name: 'Number Score',                   // Name
	higherBetter: true                      // Higher is better (it's default behaviour)
});
```

<br>
**COMMON USE**

**Check if the `Score` in the current game session has reached a certain value:**

``` js
// If the score has reached 5000 give the user a badge.
if (numScore.hasTempReached(5000)) {
	// Give a reward
}
```

<br>
**Check if the `Score` has reached a record:**

``` js
// Check if a value of 300 breaks numScore's record.
if (numScore.hasRecordReached(300)) {
	// Do something...
}
```

<br>
**Manipulate a `Score` by using its methods to get, set, increase, and decrease it.**

``` js
numScore.setTempScore(50); // numScore = 50

numScore.inc(200); // numScore = 250

numScore.dec(100); // numScore = 150

// When the level ends, the record score will be saved and
// numScore will be reset to its initial value.
```

<br>
### RangeScore

A specific type of `Score` that has an associated range. The `Score`'s  value can be only inside that range of values. 
**For example:** A puzzle or quiz can measure the user's success on a scale of 1 - 10, or a shooting `Score` can be on 
a scale of 10 to 100 according to the user's performance in the game.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var quizScore = Soomla.Models.RangeScore.create({
    itemId: 'quizScore',                // ID
	{low: 0, high: 10}                  // Range
});

var shootingScore = Soomla.Models.RangeScore.create({
	itemId: 'shootingScore',            // ID
	name: 'Shooting Score',             // Name
	higherBetter: true                  // Higher is better (it's default behaviour)
	{low: 0, high: 10}                  // Range
});
```

<br>
### VirtualItemScore

A specific type of `Score` that has an associated virtual item, whose balance is affected by the score.

**For example:** In a game that has diamonds that the user needs to collect, you would define a `VirtualCurrency` 
"diamond" and a `VirtualItemScore` "diamondScore". The balance of "diamond" changes according to "diamondScore".  

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var diamond = Soomla.Models.VirtualCurrency.create(...);
var diamondScore = Soomla.Models.VirtualItemScore.create({
	itemId: 'diamondScore',                 // ID
	associatedItemId: 'diamond_ID'          // Associated item ID
});

var coin = Soomla.Models.VirtualCurrency.create(...);
var coinScore = Soomla.Models.VirtualItemScore.create({
	itemId: 'coinScore',                    // ID
	name: 'Coin Score',                     // Name
	higherBetter: true                      // Higher is better (it's default behaviour)
	associatedItemId: 'coin_ID'             // Associated item ID
});
```

<br>
## Gate

A `Gate` is an object that defines certain criteria for progressing between the game's `World`s or `Level`s. The `Gate` 
is a criteria or list of rules which which must be met in order to enter the `World` or `Level`. The rules are based on 
components of the previous `World` or `Level`: scores achieved, missions completed, etc. The `Gate` is opened once the 
logical conditions are met. In some games, `Gate`s can be opened with a payment or social task, such as sharing the game 
on Facebook.

<div class="info-box">`Gate` is an abstract class. Below are explanations of several types of `Gate`s that implement 
`Gate` and how to instantiate them.</div>

<br>
#### **HOW TO OPEN**

All `Gate`s share the same definition, as explained above, but each `Gate` opens in a different way. Some `Gate`s need 
to be opened manually by the developer, and others will open automatically when a specific event is thrown. You'll find 
below an explanation of each type of `Gate` including how it opens.

<br>
### BalanceGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has an associated virtual item and a desired balance. The`Gate` opens **automatically** once the item's balance has reached the desired balance.

This type of gate encourages the user to collect more of some virtual item, such as coins or diamonds, and therefore creates motivation for the user to keep playing.  

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var coin = Soomla.Models.VirtualCurrency.create(...);

// Collect 50 coins to open the gate
var bGate = Soomla.Models.BalanceGate.create({
	itemId: 'bGate',                // ID
	associatedItemId: 'coin_ID',    // Associated item ID
	desiredBalance: 50              // Desired balance
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
int balance;
var isOpen;

balance = Soomla.storeInventory.getItemBalance('coin_ID');
// balance = 0

isOpen = bGate.isOpen();
//False because the coin balance hasn't reached the desired balance (50).

Soomla.storeInventory.giveItem('coin', 50);

balance = Soomla.storeInventory.getItemBalance('coin_ID');
// balance = 50

isOpen = bGate.isOpen();
// True because the balance has reached the desired balance (50).
```

<br>
### 'PurchasableGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has an associated Virtual item. This `Gate` is useful when you want to allow unlocking of certain `Level`s or `World`s only if they are purchased.

`'PurchasableGate` can be used either to monetize your game, by making the user pay real money, or to create retention by giving the user motivation to collect enough currencies to make the needed purchase.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Gate` does not open automatically when the relevant item has been purchased, but rather the developer has to *manually* open it. Once the `Gate` is opened (by calling `open()`), the purchase process of the associated virtual item begins. See "Use Case" below.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var itemToBuy = Soomla.Models.SingleUseVG.create({
    itemId: 'itemToBuy_ID',
	name: 'name',
	description: 'description',
    purchasableItem: Soomla.Models.PurchaseWithMarket.create({
      marketItem: Soomla.Models.MarketItem.create({
        productId: 'itemToBuy_ProdID',
        price: 8.99
      })
});

// The user must buy the 'itemToBuy' in order to open this Gate.
var pGate = Soomla.Models.PurchasableGate.create({
    itemId: 'pGate',                    // ID
    associatedItemId: 'itemToBuy_ID'    // Associated item ID
});
```

<br>
**USE CASE**

``` js
var isOpen;

isOpen = gate.isOpen();  // False

pGate.open(); // Eventually, open() calls Soomla.storeInventory.buyItem("itemToBuy_ID", &error);

isOpen = gate.isOpen(); // True because the shield has been purchased.
```

<br>
### RecordGate

A `RecordGate` has an associated score and a desired record. The `Gate` opens **automatically** once the player achieves the desired record.

`RecordGate` can be used to highly promote game progression. For example, if there is `RecordGate` for each level in 
the game, the user will be encouraged to continuously beat his/her own score.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
//The user needs to reach a record of 5000 for numberScore in order to open this Gate.
var rGate = Soomla.Models.RecordGate.create({
    itemId: 'rGate',                    // ID
	associatedScoreId: 'scoreID',       // Associated score ID
	desiredRecord: 5000                 // Desired record
);
```

<br>
**USE CASE**

``` js
var isOpen;
var reachedRecord;

isOpen = rGate.isOpen(); // False, because numberScore hasn't reached a record of 5000

numberScore.inc(5000.0); // Now, the value of numberScore is 5000

// Once the level ends, the score's record is saved

reachedRecord = numberScore.hasRecordReached(5000); // True!

isOpen = rGate.isOpen(); // True because numberScore has reached the record of 5000
```

<br>
### ScheduleGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has a schedule that defines when the `Gate` can be opened. The `Gate` opens **automatically** according to the defined schedule.

`ScheduleGate` can be used to create suspense and reel in the user to play at specific times that you define. For example, you can define a `ScheduleGate` that unlocks a bonus level on Friday at 5pm. Chances are that the exclusivity of the bonus level (that can only be unlocked once a week), will cause the user to make himself/herself available for play on the time you specified.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
// This Gate is open if we are within the time frame defined
// in the schedule. In this case the gate is always open.
var sGate = Soomla.Models.ScheduleGate.create({
    itemId: 'scheduleGate',                     // ID
	schedule: Schedule.createAnyTimeUnLimited() // Schedule
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
// The schedule defines this gate to be open all the time.
var isOpen = sGate.isOpen();  // TRUE!
```

<br>
### WorldCompletionGate

A `WorldCompletionGate` has an associated `World` that. Once the `World` is completed, the `Gate` **automatically** opens.

This gate is perhaps, the simplest of the gates, in that its only requirement is that the user finish the previous World in order to move on to the next.

<br>
#### **HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var worldA = Soomla.Models.World.create({itemId: 'worldA'});

var wGate = Soomla.Models.WorldCompletionGate.create({
	itemId: 'wGate',            // ID
	associatedWorldId: worldA   // Associated world ID
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
var isOpen;
var isCompleted;

isCompleted = worldA.isCompleted(); // False because worldA has not been completed.

isOpen = wGate.isOpen(); // False because worldA has not been completed.

worldA.setCompleted(true); // Set worldA as completed.

isOpen = wGate.isOpen(); // True because worldA has been completed.
```

<br>
### GatesList

A list of one or more `Gate`s that together define a composite criteria for progressing between the game's `World`s or `Level`s.

There are two kinds of `GatesList`s:

<br>
#### **GatesListAnd**

A specific type of `GatesList` that can be opened only if ALL `Gate`s in its list are open.

This gate is very demanding since it requires multiple criteria in order to be opened. Once the gate is opened, you can 
allow the user to skip one `World` and continue on to the next.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
// NOTE: wGate and rGate are defined in the sections above.

var gates = [wGate, rGate];

var wGateANDrGate = Soomla.Models.GatesListAnd.create({
    itemId: 'wGateANDrGate",
	gates: gates
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
// The user needs to meet the criteria of wGate AND of rGate
// in order to open this Gate. For the definitions of wGate and
// rGate, see the topics WorldCompletionGate and RecordGate above.

int isOpen;
var isCompleted;
var wGateIsOpen;
var rGateIsOpen;

isCompleted = worldA.isCompleted(); // False because worldA has not been completed

wGateIsOpen = wGate.isOpen(); // False because worldA has not been completed

rGateIsOpen = rGate.isOpen(); // False because numberScore hasn't reached a record of 5000

worldA.setCompleted(true); // Set worldA as completed

wGateIsOpen = wGate.isOpen(); // True because worldA has been completed

isOpen = wGateANDrGate.isOpen(); // False because we need both of the gates to be open

numberScore.inc(5000.0); // Now numberScore = 5000

// Once the level ends, the score's record is saved

isOpen = wGateANDrGate.isOpen(); // TRUE! because both gates have been opened
```

<br>
#### **GatesListOR**

A specific type of `GatesList` that can be opened if AT LEAST ONE `Gate`s in its list is open.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
// NOTE: wGate and rGate are defined in the sections above.

var gates = [wGate, rGate];

var wGateORrGate = Soomla.Models.GatesListOr.create({
    itemId: 'wGateORrGate',
	gates: gates
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
// The user needs to meet the criteria of wGate OR of rGate
// in order to open this Gate. For the definitions of wGate and
// rGate, see the topics WorldCompletionGate and RecordGate above.

var isOpen;
var wGateIsOpen;
var rGateIsOpen;
var isCompleted;

isCompleted = worldA.isCompleted(); // False because worldA has not been completed.

wGateIsOpen = wGate.isOpen(); // False because worldA has not been completed.

rGateIsOpen = rGate.isOpen();  // False because numberScore hasn't reached a record of 5000.0

worldA.setCompleted(true); // Set worldA as completed.

wGateIsOpen = wGate.isOpen();  // True because worldA has been completed.

isOpen = wGateORrGate.isOpen(); // TRUE! We only need one of the gates to be open,
// in this case it's wGate that's open.
```

<br>
### SocialActionGate

`SocialActionGate`s require the user to perform a specific social action in order to open the `Gate`s. Currently, 
the social provider that's available is Facebook, so the `Gate`s are FB-oriented. In the future, more social providers 
will be added.

`SocialActionGate`s allow you to enforce social engagement by locking certain levels or worlds behind social 
interactions. For example, you can ask your users to like your page or share a specific status about your game, and in 
return unlock a bonus level or world for them. In this win-win situation your users will be pleased, and the network 
effect will increase the popularity of your game.

<div class="info-box">`SocialActionGate` is an abstract class. Below are explanations of the four types of social 
`Gate`s that implement `SocialActionGate`. All types of `Gate`s implement the superclass `Gate` and therefore, implement 
its functionality and behavior.

Also, please note that `SocialActionGate`s are dependent on SOOMLA's [cocos2dx-profile](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-profile).</div>

<br>
### SocialLikeGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has an associated page name.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Gate` does not open automatically when the relevant page has been liked, but rather the developer has to *manually* open it. Once the `Gate` is opened (by calling `open()`), the `like()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var likeGate = Soomla.Models.SocialLikeGate.create({
	itemId: 'likeGate',                         // ID
    provider: Soomla.Models.Provider.FACEBOOK,  // Social Provider
	pageName: "[page name]"                     // Page to "Like"
});
```

<br>
### SocialStatusGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has an associated status.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Gate` does not open automatically when the relevant status has been posted, but rather the developer has to *manually* open it. Once the `Gate` is opened (by calling `open()`), the `updateStatus()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var statusGate = Soomla.Models.SocialStatusGate.create({
	itemId: 'statusGate',                       // ID
    provider: Soomla.Models.Provider.FACEBOOK,  // Social Provider
	status: '[status]'                          // Status to post
});
```

<br>
### SocialStoryGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has an associated story.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Gate` does not open automatically when the relevant story has been posted, but rather the developer has to *manually* open it. Once the `Gate` is opened (by calling `open()`), the `updateStory()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var storyGate = Soomla.Models.SocialStoryGate.create({
    itemId: 'storyGate',                        // ID
    provider: Soomla.Models.Provider.FACEBOOK,  // Social Provider
	message: '[message]',                       // Message to post
	storyName: '[Story Name]',                  // Story name
	caption: '[Caption]',                       // Caption for image
	link: '[Link]',                             // Link to post
	imgUrl: "[Image Url]'                       // Image URL
});
```

<br>
### SocialUploadGate

A specific type of `Gate` that has an associated image.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Gate` does not open automatically when the relevant image has been uploaded, 
but rather the developer has to *manually* open it. Once the `Gate` is opened (by calling `open()`), the `uploadImage()` 
function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var uploadGate = Soomla.Models.SocialUploadGate.create({
	itemId: 'uploadGate',                       // ID
    provider: Soomla.Models.Provider.FACEBOOK,  // Social Provider
	message: '[message]',                       // Message to post
	fileName: '[Filename]'                      // Image URL
});
```

<br>
## Mission

A `Mission` is a task your users need to complete in your game. `Mission`s are the glue between `Gate`s and `Reward`s; 
Specific `Reward`s can be given to users that complete `Mission`s, and every `Mission` has a `Gate` that must be opened 
in order to complete it. You can create `Mission`s and use them as single, independent entities OR create a `Challenge` 
to handle several `Mission`s and monitor their completion. Some `Mission`s may be completed multiple times.

**A `Mission` contains the following elements:**

- `rewards` - Rewards that can be earned when completing this `Mission`.

- `schedule` - A schedule that defines the number of times this `Mission` can be played, how often, etc.

- `gate` - A `Gate` that needs to be opened in order to complete this `Mission`.

<br>
#### **HOW TO COMPLETE**

All `Mission`s share the same definition, as explained above, but each `Mission` is completed in a different way. Some 
`Mission`s need to be completed manually by the developer (by calling `Complete()`), and others will automatically be 
completed when a specific event is thrown. You'll find below an explanation of each type of `Mission` including how it's 
completed.

<br>
#### **COMMON USE**

All missions have the same functionality.

**Check if a `Mission` is available:**

This function determines whether a `Mission` is available to be set as completed, by checking the criteria that makes 
the `Mission` available, as well as the number of times that this `Mission` can be completed.

For example, let's say that you allow your user to complete "mission A" once, and "Mission B" an unlimited number of 
times. In this case, when you call `isAvailable()` on "mission A", it'll return true before the user has completed 
the mission, and false afterwards. However, every time you call `isAvailable()` on "mission B", it'll return true, 
no matter how many times the mission has been completed.

``` js
if (someMission.isAvailable()) {
	//do something...
}
```

**Check if the `Mission` is completed:**

``` js
if (someMission.isCompleted()) {
	//do something...
}
```

<br>
### BalanceMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated virtual item and a desired balance. The `Mission` is 
**automatically** complete once the item's balance reaches the desired balance.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
// To complete this mission the user needs to collect 250 coins.
// Once the mission is complete he/she will receive the reward.
var bMission = Soomla.Models.BalanceMission.create({
	itemId: 'coinMission',                  // ID
	name: 'Coin Mission',                   // Name
	rewards: [balanceReward],               // Optional reward(s)
	associatedItemId: 'coinScore_ID',       // Associated Score ID
	desiredBalance: 250                     // Desired balance
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
int balance;
var isCompleted;

balance = Soomla.storeInventory.getItemBalance('coinID');
// Balance = 0

isCompleted = bMission.isCompleted(); // False because the coin balance hasn't 
                                        // reached the desired balance (250).

Soomla.storeInventory.giveItem('coinID', 250);

balance = Soomla.storeInventory.getItemBalance('coinID');
// Now balance = 250

isCompleted = bMission.isCompleted();
// True because the balance has reached the desired balance (250).
```

<br>
### RecordMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated score and a desired record. The `Mission` is **automatically** complete once the player achieves the desired record for the given score.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
// To complete this mission, the user needs his "coinScore" to reach a record of 5000.
var rMission = Soomla.Models.RecordMission.create({
	itemId: 'rMission',                 // ID
	name: 'Coin Record Score',          // Name
	rewards: coinReward,                // Optional reward(s)
	associatedScoreId: 'coinScore_ID',  // Associated Score ID
	desiredRecord: 2000                 // Desired record
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
var isCompleted;
var reachedRecord;

reachedRecord = numberScore.hasRecordReached(2000.0);
// False because numberScore has a record of 0

isCompleted = rMission.isCompleted();  
// False, because numberScore hasn't reached a record of 2000

numberScore.inc(2000.0); // Now, the value of numberScore is 2000

// Once the level ends, the score's record is saved

reachedRecord = numberScore.hasRecordReached(2000.0);
// True because numberScore has reached the record of 2000

isCompleted = rMission.isCompleted();  // TRUE!
```

<br>
### PurchasingMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated market item.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Mission` is not completed automatically when the relevant item has been 
purchased, but rather the developer has to *manually* complete it. Once the `Mission` is complete (by calling 
`complete()`), the purchase process of the associated virtual item begins. See "Use Case" below.</div>


<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var itemToBuy = Soomla.Models.SingleUseVG.create({
    itemId: 'itemToBuy_ID',
	name: 'name',
	description: 'description',
    purchasableItem: Soomla.Models.PurchaseWithMarket.create({
      marketItem: Soomla.Models.MarketItem.create({
        productId: 'itemToBuy_ProdID',
        price: 1.99
      })
});

// To complete this mission, the user needs to buy the item.
var pMission = Soomla.Models.PurchasingMission.create({
	itemId: 'pMission',                 // ID
	name: 'Purchase Mission',           // Name
	rewards: [purchaseReward],          // Optional reward(s)
	associatedItemId: 'itemToBuy_ID'    // Associated item ID
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
var isCompleted;

isCompleted = pMission.isCompleted();  // False

pMission.complete(); // Eventually, complete() calls Soomla.storeInventory.buyItem("itemToBuy_ID", &error)

isCompleted = pMission.isCompleted();  // True because the item has been purchased.
```

<br>
### WorldCompletionMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated `World`. The `Mission` is **automatically** complete once the `World` has been completed.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var worldA = Soomla.Models.World.create({itemId: 'worldA_ID'});

var wMission = Soomla.Models.WorldCompletionMission.create({
    itemId: 'wMission',             // ID
    name: 'Complete World A',       // Name
	rewards: [coinReward],          // Optional reward(s)
	associatedWorldId: 'worldA_ID'  // Associated World ID
});
```

#### **USE CASE**

``` js
var isMissionComplete;
var isWorldComplete;

isWorldComplete = worldA.isCompleted(); // False because worldA has not been completed yet.

isMissionComplete = wMission.isCompleted(); // False because worldA has not been completed.

worldA.setCompleted(true); // Set worldA as completed.

isMissionComplete = wMission.isCompleted(); // True because worldA has been completed.
```

<div class="info-box">The following `Mission`s require the user to perform a specific social action in order to receive 
a `Reward`. Currently, the social provider that's available is Facebook, so the `Mission`s are FB-oriented. In 
the future, more social providers will be added. Please note that `SocialActionGate`s are dependent on SOOMLA's 
[cocos2dx-profile](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-profile).</div>

<br>
### SocialLikeMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated page name.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Mission` is not completed automatically when the relevant page has been liked, 
but rather the developer has to *manually* complete it. Once the `Mission` is complete (by calling `complete()`), 
the `like()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var likeMission = Soomla.Models.SocialLikeMission.create({
	itemId: 'likeMission",                      // ID
	name: 'Like Mission',                       // Name
	rewards: [likeReward],                      // Optional reward(s)
    provider: Soomla.Models.Provider.FACEBOOK,  // Social Provider
    pageName: '[page name]'                     // Page to "Like"
});
```

<br>
### **SocialStatusMission**

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated status.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Mission` is not completed automatically when the relevant status has been 
posted, but rather the developer has to *manually* complete it. Once the `Mission` is complete (by calling `complete()`), 
the `updateStatus()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var statusMission = Soomla.Models.SocialStatusMission.create({
	itemId: 'statusMission',                    // ID
	name: 'Status Mission',                     // Name

});
```

<br>

### SocialStoryMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated story that includes a message, story name, caption, link, and image.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Mission` is not completed automatically when the relevant story has been 
posted, but rather the developer has to *manually* complete it. Once the `Mission` is complete (by calling `complete()`), 
the `updateStory()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
var storyMission = Soomla.Models.SocialStoryMission.create({
	itemId: 'storyMission',                     // ID
	name: 'Story Mission",                      // Name

});
```

<br>

### SocialUploadMission

A specific type of `Mission` that has an associated filename and message.

<div class="info-box">**IMPORTANT:** This `Mission` is not completed automatically when the relevant image has been 
uploaded, but rather the developer has to *manually* complete it. Once the `Mission` is complete (by calling `complete()`), 
the `uploadImage()` function is called.</div>

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js

	fileName: 'filename'                        // Image URL
});
```

<br>
## Challenge

Missions can be aggregated into challenges which can contain a single mission or multiple ones. The user is required to 
complete all these missions in order to earn the reward associated with the challenge.

<br>
**HOW TO DEFINE**

``` js
// To complete this challenge, the user must complete both missions.
// Once the challenge is complete, he/she will receive the reward(s).
// Note that wMission and rMission are defined in the examples above.
var missions = [wMission, rMission];

// To complete this challenge, the user must complete both missions.
Challenge *challenge = Soomla.Models.Challenge.create({
	itemId: 'challenge',                        // ID
	name: '2 Mission Challenge',                // Name

	rewards: [challengeReward]                 // Optional reward(s)
});
```

<br>
#### **USE CASE**

``` js
var isCompleted;

isCompleted = challenge.isCompleted(); // False because the missions haven't been completed

worldA.setCompleted(true); // Complete wMission

isCompleted = challenge.isCompleted(); // False because only 1 of 2 missions is complete

numberScore.inc(2000.0); // Now numberScore = 2000

// Once the level ends, the score's record is saved

isCompleted = challenge.isCompleted(); // TRUE! Both missions have been completed
```

## Auxiliary Models

### Schedule

A `Schedule` defines any time restrictions that an entity may have.

**A `Schedule` contains the following restrictions:**

- **Recurrence** - How often is this entity available? Every month, week, day, hour?

	**For example:** A `Mission` that is available to be completed every Monday.

- **Time Ranges** - A time range that defines when this entity is available, with a start time and an end time.

	**For example:** A `Reward` that can be given starting when the user finishes a certain `Level` and ending 8 seconds later.

- **Activation Limit** - The number of times that this entity is available for use.

	**For example:** A `Mission` that can be attempted 10 times throughout gameplay.

### Reward

<div class="info-box">Note that `Reward` is a part of soomla-cocos2dx-core, and not part of the LevelUp module. However, 
because `Reward`s are used very often throughout Levelup, it's important that you are familiar with the different `Reward` types.</div>

A `Reward` is an entity which can be earned by the user for meeting certain criteria in game progress. For example - a user can earn a badge for completing a `Mission`. Dealing with `Reward`s is very similar to dealing with `VirtualItem`s: grant a `Reward` by giving it, and recall a `Reward` by taking it.

`Reward` itself cannot be instantiated, but there are many types of rewards, all explained below, and those will have the functionality that `Reward` provides.

<br>

**COMMON USE**

All rewards have the same functionality.

**Give a `Reward`:**

Use this to give your user a `Reward`, for example you can give your users a `Reward` of 100 coins just for downloading 
your game.

``` js
reward.give();
```

**Take a `Reward`:**

Use this to redeem a `Reward` from your user.

``` js
reward.take();
```

<br>
### VirtualItemReward

A specific type of `Reward` that you can use to give your users some amount of a virtual item. **For example:** Give users 100 coins (virtual currency) for liking your page.

<div class="info-box">`VirtualItemReward` is a part of `cocos2dx-store`, and not part of the Levelup module. </div>

``` js
var coinReward = Soomla.Models.VirtualItemReward.create({
    itemId: 'coinReward',                       // ID
    name: 'Coin Reward',                        // Name
    amount: 100,                                // Amount
    associatedItemId: 'coinCurrency_ID'         // Associated item ID
});
```

<br>
### BadgeReward

A specific type of `Reward` that represents a badge with an icon. **For example:** Give the user a badge reward for posting a status on his/her wall.

``` js
var coinReward = Soomla.Models.BadgeReward.create({
	itemId: 'badge_goldMedal',             // ID
	name: 'Gold Medal'                     // Name
);
```

<br>
### SequenceReward

A specific type of `Reward` that holds a list of other `Reward`s in a certain sequence. The rewards are given in ascending order. **For example:** In a Karate game the user can progress between belts and can be rewarded a sequence of: blue belt, purple belt, brown belt, and lastly, black belt.

``` js
// Assume that the below belts are BadgeRewards that have been defined.
var belts = [blueBelt, purpleBelt, brownBelt, blackBelt];

var beltReward = Soomla.Models.SequenceReward.create({
	itemId: 'beltReward',             // ID
	name: 'Gold Medal',               // Name
	rewards: belts                    // Sequence of rewards
});
```
### RandomReward

A specific type of `Reward` that holds a list of other `Reward`s. When this `Reward` is given, it randomly chooses a `Reward` from the list of `Reward`s it internally holds. **For example:** Give users a mystery box `Reward` for uploading an image, that grants him/her a random `Reward`.

``` js
var rewards = [rewardA, rewardB];

var mysteryReward = Soomla.Models.RandomReward.create({
	itemId: 'mysteryReward',             // ID
	name: 'Mystery Box Reward',          // Name
	rewards: rewards                     // Sequence of rewards
});
```
