# Insights

## Overview

GROW Insights brings you priceless insights about your users at real-time and inside your code. You can use the provided 
insights to take actions on your users at real time during gameplay when your users actually arrive in your game. With 
Insights you can:  


- Create special prices for paying users in your genre.
- Adapt the game difficulty for the specific user.
- Create push campaigns.
- Adapt Ads to your specific users.
- A lot more ... you can create your own personalization features and even share them with others on the SOOMLA [Forums](http://answers.soom.la).

Currently, Insights supports PayInsights which categorizes users according to their pay-rank. More about this below.

## Integration

<div class="info-box">GROW Insights is included all GROW bundles: [GrowSpend](/cocos2dx/js/grow/GrowSpend_GettingStarted#SetupGrowSpend), 
[GrowViral](/cocos2dx/js/grow/GrowViral_GettingStarted#SetupGrowViral), 
[GrowCompete](/cocos2dx/js/grow/GrowCompete_GettingStarted#SetupGrowCompete), 
[GrowInsights](/cocos2dx/js/grow/GrowInsights_GettingStarted#SetupGrowInsights) and 
[GrowUltimate](/cocos2dx/js/grow/GrowUltimate_GettingStarted#SetupGrowUltimate) bundles. Please refer to the relevant 
bundle for initialization instructions.</div>


1. Initialize `GrowInsights` according to the instructions of your relevant bundle.

* Create event handler functions in order to be notified about (and handle) GROW Insights related events. See 
[Events](/cocos2dx/js/grow/Grow_Insights/#Events) for more information.

3. Once initialized, GROW Insights will automatically retrieve relevant insights from the server. Once the insights are 
ready (see [`EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED`](/cocos2dx/js/grow/Grow_Insights/#EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED)) you 
can access them as explained below.

## Observing & Handling Events

### Subscribing

Subscribe to events in the following way:

```js
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED, this.onInsightsRefreshFinished, this);
```

### Handling

Handle the event through your own custom function:

```js
this.onInsightsRefreshFinished = function () {
  // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

## Events

Following is a list of all the events in GROW Insights and an example of how to observe & handle them. The events' 
handling examples are written for v3, but it's easy to convert them to v2 dialect, see how above.

### EVENT_GROW_INSIGHTS_INITIALIZED

This event is triggered when the GROW Insights feature is initialized and ready.

``` js
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_GROW_INSIGHTS_INITIALIZED, this.onGrowInsightsInitialized, this);

this.onGrowInsightsInitialized = function () {
  // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_STARTED

This event is triggered when fetching insights from the server has started.

``` js
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_STARTED, this.onInsightsRefreshStarted, this);

this.onInsightsRefreshStarted = function () {
  // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED

This event is triggered when fetching insights from the server has finished.

``` js
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED, this.onInsightsRefreshFinished, this);

this.onInsightsRefreshFinished = function () {
  // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

### EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FAILED

This event is triggered when fetching insights from the server has failed.

``` js
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FAILED, this.onInsightsRefreshFailed, this);

this.onInsightsRefreshFailed = function () {
  // ... your game specific implementation here ...
}
```

## Main Classes & Methods

started, and one of `EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED` or `EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FAILED` is triggered depending on the 
refresh outcome.

**`GrowInsights.getUserInsights()`**

Returns the [User-Insights](/cocos2dx/js/grow/Grow_Insights/#UserInsights) received from the server.

<div class="info-box">GROW Insights caches its data on the device so that it's accessible even when there is no internet 
connection.</div>

### UserInsights

`UserInsights` holds insights related to the user currently playing the game.
Located in `GrowInsights` and can be accessed using `Soomla.growInsights.getUserInsights()`.

### Example

``` js

Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_GROW_INSIGHTS_INITIALIZED, this.onGrowInsightsInitialized, this);
Soomla.addHandler(Soomla.Models.HighwayConsts.EVENT_INSIGHTS_REFRESH_FINISHED, this.onInsightsRefreshFinished, this);

Soomla.initialize('ExampleCustomSecret');

// Initialize GrowHighway
Soomla.GrowHighway.createShared('yourGameKey', 'yourEnvKey');

// Initialize GrowInsights
Soomla.GrowInsights.createShared();


this.onGrowInsightsInitialized = function () {
    // GROW insights has been initialized.
}

this.onInsightsRefreshFinished = function () {
    if (Soomla.growInsights.getUserInsights().getPayInsights().getPayRankForGenre(Soomla.Models.Genre) > 3) {
        // ... Do stuff according to your business plan ...
    }
}


```
